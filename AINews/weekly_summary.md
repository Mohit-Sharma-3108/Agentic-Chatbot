# Weekly AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, I need to summarize these AI-related news articles into markdown format as per the user's instructions. Let me start by going through each article one by one.

First, the user wants the dates in IST in *YYYY-MM-DD* format. I'll check each article's date and convert it to IST if necessary. For example, the first article's date is Thu, 27 Nov 2025 13:16:30 GMT. Since IST is UTC+5:30, adding 5:30 to 13:16:30 GMT would make it 18:46:30 IST on the same day, so the date remains 2025-11-27. Similarly, other dates need to be adjusted accordingly.

Next, each summary should be concise. For the first article about the AI in Agriculture Market, the key points are the market growth, drivers like food demand, smart farming tech, and specific technologies mentioned. I'll need to condense that into a single sentence without losing the main points.

For the articles about the OncoMark AI framework in cancer research, I notice there are multiple articles from different sources. I should check if they're duplicates or different angles. The content from the Indianews.com.au and Ahmedabadmirror.com seem similar. I'll need to summarize them as one entry, perhaps noting the different dates but maybe they are different reports on the same development. Wait, the dates are different. The first is Nov 27, and the second is Dec 1. Wait, no, the Ahmedabad Mirror article's date is Dec 1? Wait, no, the content says "Date: Thu, 27 Nov 2025 09:44:35 GMT" but the URL is from Ahmedabad Mirror. Let me check again. The first OncoMark article is from Nov 27, the second is also Nov 27, the third is from Dec 1. Wait, the third one's date is "Date: Mon, 01 Dec 2025 01:28:18 GMT". So three different dates but same content. I need to treat them as separate entries if they are from different sources and dates, even if the content is similar.

Then there's the NTT DATA article from Dec 2 about reskilling the India workforce. The summary should mention their plan to reskill employees for AI-native development. The HSBC and Mistral AI partnership is another key point from Dec 1.

The article about China's tech giants using offshore AI model training with Nvidia chips is from Nov 27. The Cyber Startup Frenetik's AI deception technology is from Dec 2. The Wingtech and Nexperia court case from Dec 1, and the Stellantis production drop from Dec 1.

I need to sort all these by date, latest first. The latest dates are Dec 2, then Dec 1, then Nov 27. Let me list all the dates:

- Dec 2: 2 articles (NTT DATA reskilling, Cyber Startup Frenetik)
- Dec 1: 3 articles (HSBC, Wingtech, Stellantis)
- Nov 27: 3 articles (Agriculture Market, OncoMark 1, China AI offshore)
- Nov 26: HP layoffs (date is Wed, 26 Nov 2025 07:53:32 GMT, which is 2025-11-26 in IST)
- Nov 28: Qiantang District AI in pharma (Fri, 28 Nov 2025 09:33:30 GMT, IST same date)
- Nov 27: OncoMark 2 (Thu, 27 Nov 2025 09:44:35 GMT → 2025-11-27 IST)
- Dec 1: OncoMark 3 (Mon, 01 Dec 2025 01:28:18 GMT → 06:58 IST same date, so 2025-12-01)
- Dec 1: AI in manufacturing impact (Mon, 01 Dec 2025 08:03:00 GMT → 13:33 IST same date)
- Dec 1: Stellantis production drop (09:25 GMT → 14:55 IST same date)
- Dec 2: NTT DATA (08:06 GMT → 13:36 IST same date)
- Dec 2: Landfall IP AI-native (12:30 GMT → 18:00 IST same date)
- Dec 2: SpendHQ AI procurement (11:52 GMT → 17:22 IST same date)
- Dec 2: Cyber Startup Frenetik (07:35 GMT → 13:05 IST same date)

Wait, I need to check all dates again. Let me list all the dates properly:

1. **Dec 2, 2025**:
   - NTT DATA reskilling (08:06:25 GMT → 13:36 IST)
   - Landfall IP AI-native (12:30 GMT → 18:00 IST)
   - SpendHQ AI procurement (11:52 GMT → 17:22 IST)
   - Cyber Startup Frenetik (07:35:03 GMT → 13:05 IST)

2. **Dec 1, 2025**:
   - HSBC and Mistral AI (09:40:00 GMT → 15:10 IST)
   - Wingtech vs Nexperia (08:03:00 GMT → 13:33 IST)
   - Stellantis production drop (09:25:00 GMT → 14:55 IST)
   - OncoMark 3 (01:28:18 GMT → 06:58 IST)
   - AI impact on manufacturing (08:03:00 GMT → 13:33 IST)

3. **Nov 28, 2025**:
   - Qiantang District AI pharma (09:33:30 GMT → 15:03 IST)

4. **Nov 27, 2025**:
   - AI in Agriculture Market (13:16:30 GMT → 18:46 IST)
   - OncoMark 1 (06:49:30 GMT → 12:19 IST)
   - OncoMark 2 (09:44:35 GMT → 15:14 IST)
   - China AI offshore (06:07:50 GMT → 11:37 IST)
   - HP layoffs (07:53:32 GMT → 13:23 IST)

5. **Nov 26, 2025**:
   - HP layoffs (same as above?)

Wait, the HP article has date: Wed, 26 Nov 2025 07:53:32 GMT → IST is 13:23:32, so 2025-11-26.

Now, sorting by date (latest first), the order would be:

Dec 2, Dec 1, Nov 28, Nov 27, Nov 26.

Now, for each date, I need to create a section with the summaries.

For each article, make sure to list each unique article. However, the OncoMark articles are from different dates but same content. Should I combine them or list each separately? The user said "for each item include", so if they are different articles (different URLs), even with similar content, they should be separate entries.

Check the URLs:

- OncoMark 1: https://indianews.com.au/indian-scientists-tap-ai-for-personalised-cancer-therapy/
- OncoMark 2: https://www.ahmedabadmirror.com/indian-scientists-tap-ai-for-cancer-therapy/81903490.html
- OncoMark 3: https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/young-hans/scientists-tap-ai-for-personalised-cancer-therapy-1027568

These are three separate articles with same content but different URLs and dates. So each should be a separate entry.

Similarly, the AI in Agriculture Market article has the same content but different URL and date.

Now, compiling the summaries:

For each article, extract the key points. For example, the AI in Agriculture Market article mentions the market growth, drivers, and mentions Microsoft Azure FarmBeats. The summary should be concise.

For the OncoMark articles, they all mention the AI framework, its name, and its purpose. So each can be summarized as "Scientists at S N Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences introduced an AI framework called OncoMark to predict cancer behavior and enable personalized therapies."

For the NTT DATA article, the summary is about reskilling their India workforce for AI-native development.

HSBC and Mistral AI: HSBC partners with Mistral AI to enhance internal tools using generative AI.

China's tech giants moving AI model training offshore to use Nvidia chips.

HP layoffs: HP cuts workforce due to AI-driven changes.

Landfall IP launching AI-native solutions.

Cyber Startup Frenetik's deception tech against AI arms race.

SpendHQ using AI for procurement.

Wingtech vs Nexperia case.

Stellantis production drop.

AI impact on manufacturing.

Qiantang District using AI in pharma.

Now, arrange all these in the correct date order. Let me list all the entries with their dates and summaries:

**Dec 2, 2025**:
- NTT DATA reskilling
- Landfall IP AI-native
- SpendHQ AI procurement
- Cyber Startup Frenetik

**Dec 1, 2025**:
- HSBC and Mistral AI
- Wingtech vs Nexperia
- Stellantis production drop
- OncoMark 3
- AI impact on manufacturing

**Nov 28, 2025**:
- Qiantang District AI pharma

**Nov 27, 2025**:
- AI in Agriculture Market
- OncoMark 1
- OncoMark 2
- China AI offshore
- HP layoffs

**Nov 26, 2025**:
- HP layoffs (Wait, the HP article's date is Nov 26, but the content mentions a 3 days ago (Nov 23) in the Yahoo Finance article. However, the user provided the date as 2025-11-26. So the summary should be about HP cutting workforce. The content from TechTimes says "HP slashes workforce 10% as company pivots to AI".)

Now, compiling each date section with the entries, ensuring each URL is correctly linked. Also, check for duplicate content but different URLs, which should be separate entries.

I need to make sure that each summary is a concise sentence or two, and the URLs are correctly formatted as markdown links. Also, the date format is *YYYY-MM-DD* in IST.

Let me start writing the markdown.
