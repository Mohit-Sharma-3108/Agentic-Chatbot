# Daily AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to summarize these AI news articles into markdown format. The instructions mention including the date in YYYY-MM-DD format in IST, a concise summary, sorting by date (latest first), and a source URL link.

First, I need to parse each article's content and date. Let's check the dates. All the articles are from December 2, 2025, except the TechCrunch one which is dated December 2 at 00:43:37 GMT. Wait, the date is actually December 2, 2025, but the GMT time is 00:43 on the 3rd. However, converting GMT to IST (UTC+5:30) would make it December 2, 05:43:37 IST. But the user wants the date in IST. So the TechCrunch article's IST date is still 2025-12-02. All other articles are from the same day, so they'll be sorted by time. 

Now, for each article, I need to extract the summary. Let me go through each one:

1. **NTT DATA reskilling** – The key points are reskilling the India workforce for AI-native development, Global Capability Centres as growth areas, and using AI-trained talent. The URL is provided.

2. **Amazon's AI chip** – Amazon is rushing an AI chip to compete with Nvidia and Google. The URL is from Bloomberg.

3. **OpenAI's Garlic model** – They're developing a model to counter Google's gains. The URL is TheInformation.

4. **Amazon using Nvidia tech** – AWS adopting NVLink Fusion in Trainium4 and introducing Nova Forge. Reuters article.

5. **Frenetik's AI deception tech** – Cyber startup using deception against AI arms race. CSO Online.

6. **TechCrunch AI Factories** – Amazon's on-premises AI Factories with Nvidia. Date is Dec 2, 2025, but the article's GMT time is 00:43 on Dec 3. So IST would be Dec 3. Wait, but the user wants dates in IST. Let me check: The TechCrunch article's date is listed as "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 00:43:37 GMT". Converting GMT to IST adds 5h30m. 00:43 GMT +5h30m is 06:13 IST on Dec 3, 2025. So the date should be 2025-12-03. So it's on Wednesday. But all other articles are from Dec 2. So this one is the latest. Need to sort it first.

7. **The Willows at Willard** – Honored by Pioneer Career Center. The date is Dec 2, 2025.

8. **IT News Australia AWS-Nvidia** – AWS using Nvidia tech in AI chips. Date Dec 2.

9. **Negev AI center** – Canadian donor's project in Israel. Dec 2.

10. **UN report on AI inequality** – AP News article. Dec 2.

11. **Nvidia's new AI models** – Speech, safety, self-driving. Dec 2.

12. **Singapore insurers anxiety** – PwC report. Dec 2.

13. **AI in Agriculture market** – Market growth and key players. Dec 2.

14. **Google's code red scramble** – Axios article. Date is Dec 2 22:36 GMT. GMT to IST is +5h30, so IST time 04:06 Dec 3. Wait, no. GMT 22:36 is 04:06 IST next day. So the date in IST is 2025-12-03. Wait, but the original date is listed as "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 22:36:56 GMT". So GMT time is 22:36 on Dec 2. Converting to IST (UTC+5:30) is 22:36 +5h30m = 04:06:56 next day, Dec 3. Therefore, the date in IST is 2025-12-03. So this article should be the latest one.

Wait, but TechCrunch's article was dated Dec 3 in IST. So the order should be:

1. Google's code red (Dec 3)
2. TechCrunch's AI Factories (Dec 3)
3. All other articles from Dec 2.

But let me confirm the dates again.

For each article, check the date and convert to IST:

- The TechCrunch article: GMT 00:43 on Dec 3 → IST 05:43 +5h30 → 06:13 IST Dec 3 → date is 2025-12-03.

- The Axios article: GMT 22:36 on Dec 2 → IST 04:06 on Dec 3 → date is 2025-12-03.

So the two articles from Dec 3 are the latest. Then the rest from Dec 2. So sorting order should be:

1. TechCrunch (Dec 3)
2. Axios (Dec 3)
3. Then the Dec 2 articles sorted by GMT time.

Wait, but the user wants to sort by date (latest first). So first, the two Dec 3 articles, then Dec 2 articles.

Within the Dec 3 articles, sort by GMT time. TechCrunch's GMT is 00:43 Dec 3, and Axios is 22:36 Dec 2 (which is 04:06 IST Dec 3). So which one is later? The TechCrunch article has GMT 00:43 Dec 3, which is earlier than the Axios article's IST date of 04:06 Dec 3. So TechCrunch is earlier in IST on Dec 3. So the order would be:

1. TechCrunch (Dec 3)
2. Axios (Dec 3)
Then the Dec 2 articles.

So the order of the articles will be:

1. TechCrunch AI Factories (Dec 3)
2. Axios (Dec 3)
3. Then the other Dec 2 articles sorted by their GMT date.

Now, for the Dec 2 articles, the GMT times:

- NTT DATA: Tue, 02 Dec 2025 08:06:25 GMT → 13:36:25 IST Dec 2

- Bloomberg (Amazon AI chip): Tue, 02 Dec 2025 16:17:18 GMT → 21:47:18 IST

- TheInformation (OpenAI Garlic): 15:00 GMT → 20:30 IST

- Reuters (AWS NVLink): 17:29 GMT → 23:59 IST

- CSOOnline (Frenetik): 07:35 GMT → 13:05 IST

- The Willows article: 10:09 GMT → 15:39 IST

- IT News Australia: 19:39 GMT → 01:09 IST next day (Dec 3)

Wait, no, GMT 19:39 is 25:09 IST same day? Wait, GMT is 19:39, IST is GMT +5:30 → 19:39 +5h30 = 01:09 IST next day. So the IT News article's IST date is Dec 3. Wait, but the original date is listed as Tue, 02 Dec 2025 19:39:00 GMT. Converting to IST: 19:39 +5h30 = 01:09 IST Dec 3. So that article's IST date is Dec 3. But the user wants to include the date in IST. So this article should be grouped under Dec 3. However, the TechCrunch article is already under Dec 3. But the original date on the article is listed as "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 00:43:37 GMT", which converts to Dec 3 IST. The IT News article's date is GMT 19:39 Dec 2 → IST 01:09 Dec 3. So it's also Dec 3. Therefore, the IT News article should be grouped under Dec 3 as well. Wait, but in the original data, the IT News article's date is listed as Tue, 02 Dec 2025 19:39:00 GMT. So converting to IST, it's Dec 3. So that article is on Dec 3. So need to check that.

So the IT News article's date is:

Original date: Tue, 02 Dec 2025 19:39:00 GMT → IST: 19:39 +5h30 = 01:09 Dec 3. So it's on Dec 3. So this article should be grouped under Dec 3. But in the user's input, the date is listed as "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 19:39:00 GMT", which is the GMT date. The user wants the date in IST. So for that article, the IST date is 2025-12-03. So the summary should have that date.

So the Dec 3 articles are:

1. TechCrunch (Dec 3)
2. Axios (Dec 3)
3. IT News (Dec 3)

Then the rest are Dec 2.

Wait, but the IT News article's original GMT date is 19:39 Dec 2. So converting to IST is 01:09 Dec 3. Therefore, the date in IST is Dec 3. So this article should be grouped with the other Dec 3 articles. But in the user's input, the IT News article's date is listed as "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 19:39:00 GMT". So the user might have made a mistake in the date. But according to the instructions, the date should be in IST. So regardless of the original date, we need to convert it to IST. Therefore, the IT News article's date is Dec 3.

This complicates the order. So the order should be:

First, all articles from Dec 3, sorted by GMT time (since IST is the same day for GMT times that when converted are the next day). So the order of Dec 3 articles would be:

1. CSOOnline (07:35 GMT) → IST 13:05 Dec 2? No, wait. Wait, no, the CSOOnline article's date is Tue, 02 Dec 2025 07:35:03 GMT → IST 13:05 Dec 2. So that's Dec 2. The IT News article's GMT is 19:39 Dec 2 → IST 01:09 Dec 3. So that's Dec 3. The TechCrunch article's GMT is 00:43 Dec 3 → IST 06:13 Dec 3. The Axios article's GMT is 22:36 Dec 2 → IST 04:06 Dec 3. So the order of the Dec 3 articles by GMT time is:

1. Axios (22:36 Dec 2) → IST 04:06 Dec 3
2. IT News (19:39 Dec 2 → 01:09 Dec 3)
Wait no, the IT News article's GMT is 19:39 Dec 2, which is earlier than the Axios's GMT of 22:36. So the order of the Dec 3 articles by GMT is:

- IT News: 19:39 Dec 2 → IST 01:09 Dec 3

- Axios: 22:36 Dec 2 → IST 04:06 Dec 3

- TechCrunch: 00:43 Dec 3 → IST 06:13 Dec 3

So the order of Dec 3 articles is:

1. IT News (GMT 19:39)
2. Axios (GMT 22:36)
3. TechCrunch (GMT 00:43 Dec 3)

But the TechCrunch article's GMT is on Dec 3. So the order of the Dec 3 articles is sorted by GMT time.

So the final order would be:

### [2025-12-03]
- [Amazon Challenges Competitors with On-Premises Nvidia AI Factories](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-challenges-competitors-with-on-premises-nvidia-ai-factories/) (from TechCrunch)
- [Google creates "code red" scramble for its AI rivals](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/02/googles-pressure-ai-rivals) (from Axios)
- [AWS to use Nvidia tech in AI chips](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/aws-to-use-nvidia-tech-in-ai-chips-622282) (from IT News)

Then the Dec 2 articles.

Now, for the Dec 2 articles, sorted by GMT time:

1. CSOOnline: 07:35
2. NTT DATA: 08:06
3. The Willows: 10:09
4. TheInformation: 15:00
5. Bloomberg: 16:17
6. Reuters: 17:29
7. Negev AI center: 18:10
8. UN report: 05:37
9. ABS FPSO approval: 18:10
10. Nvidia models: 15:01
11. Singapore insurers: 07:00
12. Agriculture market: 05:46

Wait, need to sort all Dec 2 articles by GMT date:

The GMT times for Dec 2 articles:

- CSOOnline: 07:35
- NTT DATA: 08:06
- The Willows: 10:09
- TheInformation: 15:00
- Bloomberg: 16:17
- Reuters: 17:29
- Negev AI center: 18:10
- ABS FPSO: 18:10
- UN report: 05:37 (GMT 05:37 is 11:07 IST Dec 2)
- Singapore insurers: 07:00
- Nvidia models: 15:01
- Agriculture market: 05:46 (GMT 05:46 → 11:16 IST Dec 2)

So sorted by GMT time (earliest first):

1. Agriculture market: 05:46
2. UN report: 05:37
3. Singapore insurers: 07:00
4. CSOOnline: 07:35
5. NTT DATA: 08:06
6. The Willows: 10:09
7. TheInformation: 15:00
8. Nvidia models: 15:01
9. Bloomberg: 16:17
10. Reuters: 17:29
11. Negev AI center: 18:10
12. ABS FPSO: 18:10

Wait, the ABS FPSO and Negev are both at 18:10. Need to check which one is earlier. Let me check the dates:

The ABS FPSO article's date is Tue, 02 Dec 2025 18:10:15 GMT

The Negev AI center is Tue, 02 Dec 2025 18:10:15 GMT? No, looking back:

Content for ABS FPSO: Date: Tue, 02 Dec 2025 18:10:15 GMT

Content for Negev: Date: Tue, 02 Dec 2025 18:18:26 GMT

So the ABS FPSO is at 18:10 and Negev is at 18:18. So the order is ABS FPSO first, then Negev.

So the sorted list for Dec 2:

1. Agriculture market (05:46)
2. UN report (05:37)
3. Singapore insurers (07:00)
4. CSOOnline (07:35)
5. NTT DATA (08:06)
6. The Willows (10:09)
7. TheInformation (15:00)
8. Nvidia models (15:01)
9. Bloomberg (16:17)
10. Reuters (17:29)
11. ABS FPSO (18:10)
12. Negev AI center (18:18)

Now, compiling all the summaries:

For each article, extract a concise summary. Let's go step by step.

1. **TechCrunch Dec 3**: Amazon's AI Factories for on-premises use with Nvidia tech. Competes with Microsoft's Superfactories.

2. **Axios Dec 3**: Google's Gemini model and potential threat to rivals, Meta possibly using Google's TPUs.

Yes, 16 articles. Now, after grouping and sorting, the markdown should list the dates in order, with each date's articles ordered by GMT time.

Now, writing the markdown:

Start with Dec 3, then Dec 2.

For each date, list the summaries with the source URLs.

Make sure to use the correct date in IST format.

Double-check the dates for each article after conversion.

Now, compiling the final markdown.
